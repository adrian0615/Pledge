TITLE
Pledge

DESCRIPTION
Pledge is a non-profit events application that allows users to search non-profit events in their area.  It has always been a passion of mine to give back to the community. But I seem to always let work and life get in the way of reaching that goal.  I wanted to provide a convenient and centralized app for people, like me, to find community events, charities, and fundraisers that have meaning to them.


GETTING STARTED
Prerequisites - You will need to have Xcode 8.3.1 or higher and an updated iPhone simulator/iOS device with iOS 9 or higher to run this application
Instructions - Download the repository from Github and save it to your computer.  Using Xcode, open "Pledge App.xcodeproj".  If you have an iPhone connect it to your computer and select it from the device selection dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the Xcode window. Or select an iPhone 6 or higher to use the simulator.  Build and run the app by pressing "Command+R" or clicking the triangle "Play" button in the upper left corner of the Xcode window. 


TESTING
I focused my testing on making sure I was sending/receiving the right information to/from the API.

BUILT WITH
Language(s): Swift 3, JSON
Framework(s): Foundation, UIKit, WebKit
API(s): EventBrite

CHALLENGES AND LESSONS
My main struggles came from manipulating dates and times in Swift.  I'm proud that I was able to overcome that.  
I learned how to ask the user for permissions and work with WebKit
