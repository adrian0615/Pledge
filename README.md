TITLE
Pledge

DESCRIPTION
Pledge is a non-profit events application that allows users to create and attend non-profit events in their area.  The user can also look up charities and fundraisers in their general area with the added bonus of being able to donate to select charities through the application.  It has always been a passion of mine to give back to the community. But I seem to always let work and life get in the way of reaching that goal.  I wanted to provide a convenient and centralized app for people, like me, to find community events, charities, and fundraisers that have meaning to them.


GETTING STARTED
Prerequisites - You will need to have Xcode 8.3.1 or higher and an updated iPhone simulator/iOS device with iOS 10 or higher to run this application
Instructions - Download the repository from Github and save it to your computer.  Using Xcode, open "Pledge App.xcodeproj".  If you have an iPhone connect it to your computer and select it from the device selection dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the Xcode window. Or select an iPhone 6 or higher to use the simulator.  Build and run the app by pressing "Command+R" or clicking the triangle "Play" button in the upper left corner of the Xcode window. 


TESTING
I focused my testing on making sure I was sending/receiving the right information to/from the server, the orghunter.com API, and the predictHQ.com API.

BUILT WITH
Language(s): Swift 3, JSON
Framework(s): Foundation, UIKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, AddressBookUI, WebKit
API(s): herokuapp.com, orghunter.com, predicthq.com

CHALLENGES AND LESSONS
My main struggles came from manipulating dates and times in Swift.  I'm proud that I was able to overcome that.  
I learned how to use GPS, ask the user for permissions, work with MapKit, work with CoreLocation and AddressBookUI, and work with WebKit
